# Visual-Memory-Test
A tiny visual memory test
In this visual memory test the task is to find 10 related pairs of cards in the shortest possible time.
Click on the back of a downside card. The card will turn. Then click on another downside card that you assume is its pair. This card is also back. If the cards are the same, they stay upside-down. Otherwise, both cards face down.

The game ends when all ten pairs are found.

When the program is started, the cards are in the next order on the board: the card in column 1 of row 1 is the same as in column 1 of row 3, row 1 column 2 same as row 3 column 2, and so on.

Pressing the New Game button randomly divides the cards.

By pressing F11 the program switches to fullscreen mode and you can return with the Esc key.
